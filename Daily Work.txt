***********************************************
Now let's introduce the ? operator. In this example we are looking for each file whose second letter is i. As you can see, the pattern can be built up using several wildcards.

ls ?i*

for 3 letter extension
ls *.??? o/p raj.exe jem.png file.txt 1.txt

ls *.txt
o/p: 1.txt file.txt

And finally the range operator ( [ ] ). Unlike the previous 2 wildcards which specified any character, the range operator allows you to limit to a subset of characters. In this example we are looking for every file whose name either begins with a s or v.

ls [sv]*
secondfile video.mpeg

ls *[0-9]*
foo1 foo2 foo3
Move all files of type either jpg or png (image files) into another directory.
mv public_html/*.??g public_html/images/

First get the public ssh key in your local Machine
by typing ssh-keygen

Then Go to the folder where the public key has created that is .ssh
cd .ssh
then 
$scp id_rsa.pub clientHostname@IpAddress:/home/clientHostName/.ssh

Now it will be copied to the Client machine i.e virtual machine

Go to VM then type $cd .ssh
$ls -lah or $ ls -ltr
you can see the pub file now wee have to rename id_rsa.pub file to authorized_keys for that

$mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
